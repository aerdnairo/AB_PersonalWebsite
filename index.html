            <p>Hello reader, I am Andrea Brigliadori. In this page, I present lines of research I would like to investigate, and some articles I have written. <br>
            I am interested in pursuing research in computational neuroscience or computational biology. I would like to search AI-based solutions to existing problems,
            with a particular focus on clinical applicability. My objective is to concretely contribute to the collective wellbeing through the knowledge acquired during my studies. <br>
            The following are two examples of research projects I find interesting:<br> 1.The High-Dimensional Neurology Group (UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology) builds models of brain disorders that fit into existing clinical processes, aiming to quickly turn their research into real-world medical tools.<br>
            2. The project of Dr. Zitnik's lab (Harvard Medical School, Department of Biomedical Informatics) on contextually adaptive AI aims to improve algorithms so they can learn from less data and make sense of unseen situations such as unfamiliar patients, diseases, or cell types. <br>
            Topic of MSc thesis: Improving the clinical applicability of Spherical CNNs to dMRI by increasing their robustness to unseen scanner settings.<br>
            Topic of BSc thesis: Improving the biological reliability of statistical physics models for place cells.</p>

                    <button class="abstract-button" onclick=dropDown(3)>Abstract</button>

                        <p>This work focuses on quantifying iron overload in the liver from magnetic resonance images. Measuring
                        the amount of iron in the body is essential for the treatment of patients suffering from thalassemias, a
                        class of widespread genetic diseases compromising the production of red blood cells. Without frequent blood
                        transfusions, many of these patients do not reach the age of five. In turn, transfusions may lead to toxic
                        accumulations of iron, potentially inducing severe health complications such as cardiac failure. In order to
                        prevent this, it is critical to remove the excess iron in the body. At present, the only effective method is to
                        use medications able to bind iron and assist in its excretion. However, it is necessary to tailor the length and
                        intensity of this therapy to the specific patient, hence clinicians need to know the amount of surplus iron
                        to remove. To approach this problem, computational models have been developed and applied on magnetic
                        resonance images to estimate liver iron overload, which has been shown to closely relate to the total body
                        iron content. In this study, we contribute to the field with an in-depth analysis of one of these methods, obtaining promising estimation results.</p>

                        Function and subcellular environment of a protein are tightly related. Because of this, localising a protein
                        can be of great utility in investigating its purpose. This, in turn, is a critical step in obtaining insights that
                        can guide tailored drug design for a disease. Currently, one of the gold standards for conducting protein
                        localisation is fluorescent microscopy imaging in a wet lab. However, the rapidly increasing amount of data
                        generated by proteomics demands more efficient strategies. In this context, machine learning poses itself as
                        an invaluable option to effectively complement the research conducted in the wet lab. We here pursue a
                        study on the application of machine learning methods to protein subcellular localisation, aiming to maintain
                        rigour and correctness throughout the work. The positive results obtained by our Voting Classifier confirm
                        potential of this interdisciplinary approach.

                        The modelling of place cells within the framework of statistical physics is here studied. Neurons are represented as binary units that can be organized in different orders, each corresponding to a specific cognitive map. Clusters of closely situated active neurons form "activity bumps" within the map that is then indicated as the one recalled by the network. During transition phases, these bumps may shift from one map to another. The nature of these transitions allows for the classification into distinct phases: one-bump, two-bump, spin glass, and paramagnetic.

                        The instance of an earlier attractor neural network is further developed by incorporating bioinspired components, and is used for a comparative analysis of the results. Specifically, a Poisson process, theta waves and an evolving external stimulus are integrated into the model, yielding novel interesting outcomes.

                        Biosensors are becoming an increasingly popular method of detecting specific chemical substances via the combination of a biological component and modern technologies.
                        Protein react in a unique way to aptamers, so certain aptamers can be used on a biosensor to capture specific proteins. The crucial point is the binding affinity between a protein-aptamer pair, which can be measured with Kd values, where lower figures indicate better affinity. In a traditional lab setting, testing
                        the binding affinity between one protein and aptamer pair proves too costly in terms of both time and money. This is where machine learning comes in. Given protein-aptamer complexes as input, machine learning models are able to rank them in order of binding
                        affinity. This implicitly helps identify which aptamers bind best to which proteins and may find applications in the search for a simpler and time-saving way to build biosensors able to detect proteins.

                        This research aims to enhance the understanding
                        and visualization of brain activity in conditions
                        like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and severe neurological damage, which impair cognitive and motor functions. By developing methods to decode fMRI signals, we plan to visualize thoughts
                        and intended communications, aiding clinicians in ”reading” the thoughts of those unable to express themselves. This work also optimizes the ”Brain Diffuser” framework for use on standard computers, broadening accessibility and fostering innovation in neuroimaging.

                        If it is true that there are still several major milestones AI needs to overcome to reach human-level, on the other hand it has nowadays made its way into the biological field, demonstrating its worth through innovative procedures and playing a critical role in the context of life sciences and health. Not by chance, the cost of a human genome sequence dropped from an estimated 1 million dollars in 2007, to 1000 dollars in 2014, and today it is approximately $600, while the time needed for vaccine development decreased from nearly a hundred years at the beginning of the 20th century, to the few months that provided us with the COVID vaccine.

                        In this research, we will employ large datasets about gene expression of cancerous cells maintained in two different conditions, hypoxia or normoxia. The overall aim is being able to understand and analyse the data through the implementation of machine learning algorithm and visualization methods, extracting from them the most important notions.

                        Finally, this information will be used to build a classifier, with the scope of answering a precise final question: can we identify hypoxic cells?
